# Notes from Project Review

## General

* If you are curious, another interesting and very performant alternative is
[YOLO](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.08242) which stands for [You Only Look
Once](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/), a state-of-the-art real-time object
detection system.

** Feature Extraction/ HOG

* If you desire to further experiment here I recommend trying the
  [RandomForests](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html)
  classifier.
